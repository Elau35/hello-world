Hello Goblins!

I'm a 5th level Barbarian who likes to swing my axe until I forget where I am.
Seems like I wandered into your camp this fine evening. I'd blame the chef if I were you.
I only followed that delicious smell of roasting meat on the fire. 
We all know where this is going to go from here, so I'll let you in on something.
I may not be much of a chef myself, but I do make a mean goblin stew! :)
